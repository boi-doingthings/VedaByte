    "text": "These pointers are based upon my limited observations from the cities of Da Nang, Hoi An, Hanoi and Haiphong.\n\n\n\nExtremely polite and helpful. The language barrier is real. Translation app are helpful, but the non verbal communication is the key.\nEmpathy outshines. People put in their time to understand your difficulty and help you find the best solution possible.\nNo tourist sucking mentality. By that I mean, they don’t think of tourist as a target to extract money.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a pure vegetarian goto place. Pork and Beef are part of staple diet. Thus, find their place in more or less every single dish.\nVeg and vegan options are available but take all options with a pinch of salt.\nVietnam is second largest coffee producing nation. A number of coffee options across the country, be it coffee house chains like Highland, The Coffee House or local themed cafe’s.\nEgg Coffee is a local favourite. The taste was very good but I didn’t like it much due of the smell of the raw egg. Never have it as the end drink.\nGreen Tea is preferred in different styles. I found Lotus and Jasmine Tea as something new.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot too many cars but way too many 2 wheelers.\nThe cars were majorly from Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Toyota and Vinfast (similar to Vietnam’s Tesla).\nMost cars were equipped with top quality features both electronic and comfort related.\nExpensive mobile phones, particularly the latest gen iPhones were extremely common.It appears to be more of a status symbol than actual utility given the average income of the country.\nThe upliftment in living conditions and social status is kinda recent, with the youth being the visible proof of economic prosperity. The recent development schemes seem to have reduced the income inequalities.\nNot many international ATMs.\nToo many banks but none of them being very widely known.\n\n\n\n\nThe new and modern portions are really well planned with a both economomic and strategic long term objectives.\n\nRoads: Excellent weather proof roads all around. Despite being a high rainfall country, roads, primarily basalt based, are maintained well.\nAirports: Sufficient to contain the demands. Airport demand is quite peaky due to limited number of flights.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen are highly entrepreneurial and a major part of the workforce.\nHighly visible in maintaining their own hospitality driven businesses like food and drink outlets, hostels and hotels, travel bureaus etc.\nProstitution is a white crime.
