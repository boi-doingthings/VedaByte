    "text": "A few tricks learnt along the “ways”.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways get the tyre pressures checked before embarking any journey. It is crucial for vehicle stability and mileage.\nInvest some money and get a dashcam and mobile stand installed. Dashcam feeds are the best evidence in case of a mishap.\nOn a foggy road, always drive behind a bigger vehicle say a truck or bus. But be sure to maintain sufficient distance.\nWhile driving if a person suddenly comes on the road crossing your path, act as follows:\n\nFor Kids: Try to turn vehicle in the direction opposite of child’s motion.\nFor Elderly: Remain in your line and brake, they mostly a backstep\nFor Women: Slow down as quickly as you can.\n\nNever switch ON AC and slow music, while you are the lone driver in a night.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a roadways bus, try to get a seat between both axles. Never sit above the back axle.\nNever sit at the absolute front, since buses dont have a strong front structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways do Ticket Booking from IRCTC’s site under your own login credentials.\nWhen unable to get a ticket but travel is compulsary, use this site. This gives you station A to station B seat wise availability, so that you can get a part ticket via the Train Ticket Examiner (TTE).\nWhen travelling alone, prefer to take upper birth if your height is above 5’7” (170CM) else take the Side Upper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse SkyScanner and MMT to get the quotes. Third Party sites will give you ₹1000 cashback and then charge ₹1100 in convinience fees.\nVistara &gt; Indigo &gt; Jet Airways &gt; SpiceJet : General Preference but yeah prices matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways carry a copy of your passport (in paper and digital).\nNever get currency exchanged at Airports or nearby shops."
