# Modes of Transport
A few tricks learnt along the "ways".

## Roadways
### Private Vehicle  

1.  Always get the tyre pressures checked before embarking any journey. It is crucial for vehicle stability and mileage.
2.  Invest some money and get a dashcam and mobile stand installed. Dashcam feeds are the best evidence in case of a mishap.
3.  On a foggy road, always drive behind a bigger vehicle say a truck or bus. But be sure to maintain sufficient distance.
4.  While driving if a person suddenly comes on the road crossing your path, act as follows:
    *   For Kids: Try to turn vehicle in the direction opposite of child’s motion.
    *   For Elderly: Remain in your line and brake, they mostly a backstep
    *   For Women: Slow down as quickly as you can.
5.  Never switch ON AC and slow music, while you are the lone driver in a night.

### Public Vehicle
1.  On a roadways bus, try to get a seat between both axles. Never sit above the back axle.
2.  Never sit at the absolute front, since buses dont have a strong front structure.
